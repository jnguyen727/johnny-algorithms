# Competitive Programming Notes and Solutions

This repository contains my personal notes and solutions for problems from LeetCode and Codeforces. Do not expect perfect or optimal solutions.
It is not meant as a showcase but as a personal record to help me learn, remember key ideas, and track my improvement over time.

Codeforces: https://codeforces.com/profile/jnguyen727

Each solution includes a brief explanation of the approach and the time and space complexity. I update this repository regularly as I practice and revisit old problems.

## Purpose

* Reinforce concepts in algorithms and data structures
* Keep a written record of problem-solving patterns and mistakes
* Build long-term memory through repetition and review
* Track personal progress over time

## Format

For each problem, I include:

* The problem link and short summary
* My reasoning or approach
* The final implementation (C++)
* Time and space complexity analysis

All write-ups use simple Markdown for readability.
LaTeX is used only for short formulas or mathematical notation when needed.

## Notes

This repository is for personal learning and reflection.
Solutions may not always be optimal, but they represent my understanding and thought process at the time of solving.
Older solutions may be revisited and improved as I continue learning, but that is not a guarantee.
